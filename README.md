# PorkchopPlots
This is a MATLAB code that produces Porkchop Plots for a given interplanetary trajectory.
The code includes a Lambert Solver which must be run parallel to the Porkchop Plot file.
The Lambert Solver includes all the functions required to solve Lambert's problem, giving the velocity vector of point 1 and 2 of a given trajectory as an output.
