# PorkchopPlots
This is a MATLAB code that produces Porkchop Plots for a given interplanetary trajectory.
The code includes a Lambert Solver using the universal method (Universal_Lambert_Solver) and a Lambert Solver using Battin method (Battin_Lambert_Solver) which must be run parallel to the function that accompany them (more information within each code).
The Lambert Solver includes all the functions required to solve Lambert's problem, giving the velocity vector of point 1 and 2 of a given trajectory as an output.
